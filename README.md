# Data Analyst Salary Prediction

## ðŸš€ Overview
This project predicts salaries for **Data Analyst** positions based on various factors such as company ratings, job location, industry, and job descriptions. It utilizes machine learning models like **Linear Regression**, **KNN**, **Random Forest**, **Decision Tree**, and **XGBoost** to predict salaries, with data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation incorporated for improved performance.

## ðŸ“‚ Files/
- **dataanalystsalarypredection.py** â€“ Main Python script for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.
- **DataAnalyst.csv** â€“ Dataset containing job listings with features like company rating, job title, location, and salary.
- **Project_Report.docx** â€“ Detailed report summarizing the analysis, model performance, and insights.

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights
âœ” **Company Rating** and **Location** are significant predictors of salary.  
âœ” The **Random Forest** model performed the best in predicting salaries after hyperparameter tuning.  
âœ” Dimensionality reduction using **PCA** helped improve model efficiency.
